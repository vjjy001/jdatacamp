Writing out your results to a csv for submission
At last, you're ready to submit some predictions for scoring. In this exercise, you'll write your predictions to a .csv using the .to_csv() method on a pandas DataFrame. Then you'll evaluate your performance according to the LogLoss metric discussed earlier!

You'll need to make sure your submission obeys the correct format.

To do this, you'll use your predictions values to create a new DataFrame, prediction_df.

Interpreting LogLoss & Beating the Benchmark:

When interpreting your log loss score, keep in mind that the score will change based on the number of samples tested. To get a sense of how this very basic model performs, compare your score to the DrivenData benchmark model performance: 2.0455, which merely submitted uniform probabilities for each class.

Remember, the lower the log loss the better. Is your model's log loss lower than 2.0455?

predictions = clf.predict_proba(holdout[NUMERIC_COLUMNS].fillna(-1000))

# Format predictions in DataFrame: prediction_df
prediction_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=pd.get_dummies(df[LABELS]).columns,
                             index=holdout.index,
                             data=predictions)


# Save prediction_df to csv
prediction_df.to_csv('predictions.csv')

# Submit the predictions for scoring: score
score = score_submission(pred_path='predictions.csv')

# Print score
print('Your model, trained with numeric data only, yields logloss score: {}'.format(score))
