Setting up a train-test split in scikit-learn
Alright, you've been patient and awesome. It's finally time to start training models!

The first step is to split the data into a training set and a test set. Some labels don't occur very often, but we want 
to make sure that they appear in both the training and the test sets. We provide a function that will make sure at least min_count examples of each label appear in each split: multilabel_train_test_split.

Feel free to check out the full code for multilabel_train_test_split here.

You'll start with a simple model that uses just the numeric columns of your DataFrame when calling multilabel_train_test_split. The data has been read into a DataFrame df and a list consisting 
of just the numeric columns is available as NUMERIC_COLUMNS.

# Create the new DataFrame: numeric_data_only
# create feature data which is fte and total
numeric_data_only = df[NUMERIC_COLUMNS].fillna(-1000)

# Get labels and convert to dummy variables: label_dummies
# convert all the target labels to dummmies binary value
#all labels had converted to catogory
label_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df[LABELS])

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = multilabel_train_test_split(numeric_data_only,
                                                            label_dummies,
                                                             size=0.2, 
                                                               seed=123)

# Print the info
print("X_train info:")
print(X_train.info())
print("\nX_test info:")  
print(X_test.info())
print("\ny_train info:")  
print(y_train.info())
print("\ny_test info:")  
print(y_test.info())
